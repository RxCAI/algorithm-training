{"id":"299","name":"Bulls and Cows","link":"/problems/bulls-and-cows/","ac":"27.3%","difficulty":"Easy","description":"<p>You are playing the following <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows\" target=\"_blank\">Bulls and Cows</a> game with your friend: You write down a number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. Each time your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint that indicates how many digits in said guess match your secret number exactly in both digit and position (called &quot;bulls&quot;) and how many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position (called &quot;cows&quot;). Your friend will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.</p><p>\r\nFor example:\r\n<pre>\r\nSecret number:  &quot;1807&quot;\r\nFriend&apos;s guess: &quot;7810&quot;\r\n</pre>\r\nHint: <code>1</code> bull and <code>3</code> cows. (The bull is <code>8</code>, the cows are <code>0</code>, <code>1</code> and <code>7</code>.)\r\n</p><p>Write a function to return a hint according to the secret number and friend&apos;s guess, use <code>A</code> to indicate the bulls and <code>B</code> to indicate the cows. In the above example, your function should return <code>&quot;1A3B&quot;</code>. </p><p>Please note that both secret number and friend&apos;s guess may contain duplicate digits, for example:\r\n<pre>\r\nSecret number:  &quot;1123&quot;\r\nFriend&apos;s guess: &quot;0111&quot;\r\n</pre>\r\nIn this case, the 1st <code>1</code> in friend&apos;s guess is a bull, the 2nd or 3rd <code>1</code> is a cow, and your function should return <code>&quot;1A1B&quot;</code>.\r\n</p><p>You may assume that the secret number and your friend&apos;s guess only contain digits, and their lengths are always equal.</p><p><b>Credits:</b><br>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/jeantimex\">@jeantimex</a> for adding this problem and creating all test cases.</p>"}
