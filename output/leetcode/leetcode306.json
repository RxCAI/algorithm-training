{"id":"306","name":"Additive Number","link":"/problems/additive-number/","ac":"23.9%","difficulty":"Medium","description":"<p>Additive number is a string whose digits can form additive sequence.</p><p>A valid additive sequence should contain <b>at least</b> three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.</p><p>\r\nFor example:<br>\r\n<code>&quot;112358&quot;</code> is an additive number because the digits can form an additive sequence: <code>1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8</code>.\r\n<pre>1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8</pre>\r\n<code>&quot;199100199&quot;</code> is also an additive number, the additive sequence is: <code>1, 99, 100, 199</code>.\r\n<pre>1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199</pre>\r\n</p><p>\r\n<b>Note:</b> Numbers in the additive sequence <b>cannot</b> have leading zeros, so sequence <code>1, 2, 03</code> or <code>1, 02, 3</code> is invalid.\r\n</p><p>Given a string containing only digits <code>&apos;0&apos;-&apos;9&apos;</code>, write a function to determine if it&apos;s an additive number.</p><p>\r\n<b>Follow up:</b><br>\r\nHow would you handle overflow for very large input integers?\r\n</p><p><b>Credits:</b><br>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/jeantimex\">@jeantimex</a> for adding this problem and creating all test cases.</p>"}
