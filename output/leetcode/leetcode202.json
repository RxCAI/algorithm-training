Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.</p><p><b>Example:&#xA0;</b>19 is a happy number</p><p><b>Credits:</b><br>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/mithmatt\">@mithmatt</a> and <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/ts\">@ts</a> for adding this problem and creating all test cases.</p>"}
