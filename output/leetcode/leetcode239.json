{"id":"239","name":"Sliding Window Maximum","link":"/problems/sliding-window-maximum/","ac":"25.3%","difficulty":"Hard","description":"<p>Given an array <i>nums</i>, there is a sliding window of size <i>k</i> which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the <i>k</i> numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.</p><p>For example,<br>\r\nGiven <i>nums</i> = <code>[1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7]</code>, and <i>k</i> = 3.</p><p>Therefore, return the max sliding window as <code>[3,3,5,5,6,7]</code>.</p><p><b>Note: </b><br>\r\nYou may assume <i>k</i> is always valid, ie: 1 &#x2264; k &#x2264; input array&apos;s size for non-empty array.</p><p><b>Follow up:</b><br>\r\nCould you solve it in linear time?</p>"}
