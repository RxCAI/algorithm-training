If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.\r\n</p><p>For example:</p><p>There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So the correct course order is <code>[0,1]</code></p><p>There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. So one correct course order is <code>[0,1,2,3]</code>. Another correct ordering is<code>[0,2,1,3]</code>.</p><p><b>Note:</b><br>\r\nThe input prerequisites is a graph represented by <b>a list of edges</b>, not adjacency matrices.
