The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid.

If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately. </p><p>Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (<i>negative</i> integers) upon entering these rooms; \r\nother rooms are either empty (<i>0&apos;s</i>) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight&apos;s health (<i>positive</i> integers).</p><p>In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step. </p><p><b>Write a function to determine the knight&apos;s minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.</b></p><p>For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least <b>7</b> if he follows the optimal path <code>RIGHT-&gt; RIGHT -&gt; DOWN -&gt; DOWN</code>.</p><p><b>Notes:</b>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The knight&apos;s health has no upper bound.</li>\r\n<li>Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.  </li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</p><p><b>Credits:</b><br>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://oj.leetcode.com/discuss/user/stellari\">@stellari</a> for adding this problem and creating all test cases.</p>"}
