{"id":"274","name":"H-Index","link":"/problems/h-index/","ac":"27.8%","difficulty":"Medium","description":"<p>\r\nGiven an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher&apos;s h-index.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAccording to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index\" target=\"_blank\">definition of h-index on Wikipedia</a>: &quot;A scientist has index <i>h</i> if <i>h</i> of his/her <i>N</i> papers have <b>at least</b> <i>h</i> citations each, and the other <i>N &#x2212; h</i> papers have <b>no more than</b> <i>h</i> citations each.&quot;\r\n</p><p>\r\nFor example, given <code>citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5]</code>, which means the researcher has <code>5</code> papers in total and each of them had received <code>3, 0, 6, 1, 5</code> citations respectively. Since the researcher has <code>3</code> papers with <b>at least</b> <code>3</code> citations each and the remaining two with <b>no more than</b> <code>3</code> citations each, his h-index is <code>3</code>.\r\n</p><p>\r\n<b>Note</b>: If there are several possible values for <code>h</code>, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.\r\n</p><p><b>Credits:</b><br>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/jianchao.li.fighter\">@jianchao.li.fighter</a> for adding this problem and creating all test cases.</p>"}
