{"id":"278","name":"First Bad Version","link":"/problems/first-bad-version/","ac":"21.4%","difficulty":"Easy","description":"<p>\r\nYou are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad. \r\n</p><p>\r\nSuppose you have <code>n</code> versions <code>[1, 2, ..., n]</code> and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.\r\n</p><p>\r\nYou are given an API <code>bool isBadVersion(version)</code> which will return whether <code>version</code> is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.\r\n</p><p><b>Credits:</b><br>Special thanks to <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/discuss/user/jianchao.li.fighter\">@jianchao.li.fighter</a> for adding this problem and creating all test cases.</p>"}
