(ie, <code>&quot;ACE&quot;</code> is a subsequence of <code>&quot;ABCDE&quot;</code> while <code>&quot;AEC&quot;</code> is not).\r\n</p><p>\r\nHere is an example:<br>\r\n<b>S</b> = <code>&quot;rabbbit&quot;</code>, <b>T</b> = <code>&quot;rabbit&quot;</code>\r\n</p><p>\r\nReturn <code>3</code>.\r\n</p>"}
