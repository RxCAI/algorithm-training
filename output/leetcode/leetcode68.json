Pad extra spaces <code>&apos; &apos;</code> when necessary so that each line has exactly <i>L</i> characters.\r\n</p><p>\r\nExtra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFor the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.\r\n</p><p>\r\nFor example,<br>\r\n<b>words</b>: <code>[&quot;This&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;an&quot;, &quot;example&quot;, &quot;of&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, &quot;justification.&quot;]</code><br>\r\n<b>L</b>: <code>16</code>.\r\n</p><p>\r\nReturn the formatted lines as:<br>\r\n<pre>\r\n[\r\n   &quot;This    is    an&quot;,\r\n   &quot;example  of text&quot;,\r\n   &quot;justification.  &quot;\r\n]\r\n</pre>\r\n</p><p>\r\n<b>Note:</b> Each word is guaranteed not to exceed <i>L</i> in length.\r\n</p><p><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"showSpoilers(this); return false;\">click to show corner cases.</a></p>"}
